Here ‘large’ can typically mean either of two things:\n","\n","- Large enough to enhance the tendency of a model to overfit (as low as 10 variables might cause overfitting)\n","- Large enough to cause computational challenges. With modern systems, this situation might arise in case of millions or billions of features\n","\n","Though Ridge and Lasso might appear to work towards a common goal, the inherent properties and practical use cases differ substantially. Generally, they work by penalizing the magnitude of coefficients of features along with minimizing the error between predicted and actual observations. These are called ‘regularization’ techniques. Regularization reduces the model complexity and prevents over-fitting. The key difference is in how they assign penalty to the coefficients:\n","\n","**Regression:**\n","\n","$$\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1  x_1 + \\beta_2  x_2 + ... + \\beta_n  x_n $$\n","\n","- Minimize Error: $$\\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(y - \\hat{y})^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(y -  \\beta_0 - \\beta_1  x_1 - \\beta_2  x_2 - ... - \\beta_n  x_n )^2}$$\n","\n","**Lasso Regression:**\n","\n","**LASSO** stands for ``Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator`` where emphasis on the 2 key words – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection‘.\n","\n","Lasso regression performs **L1 regularization**, i.e. it adds a factor of sum of absolute value of coefficients in the optimization objective.\n","\n","- Minimize Error: $$\\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(y - \\hat{y})^2} + \\alpha\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {|\\beta_i|} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(y -  \\beta_0 - \\beta_1  x_1 - \\beta_2  x_2 - ... - \\beta_n  x_n )^2} + \\alpha\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {|\\beta_i|}$$\n","\n","Thus, lasso regression optimizes the following:\n","\n","**Objective = RSS + α * (sum of absolute value of coefficients)**\n","\n","Here, α (alpha) works similar to that of ridge and provides a trade-off between balancing RSS and magnitude of coefficients.

Lets analyze these under three buckets:\n","\n","1. Key Difference\n","\n","    - **Ridge:** It includes all (or none) of the features in the model. Thus, the major advantage of ridge regression is *coefficient shrinkage* and *reducing model complexity*.\n","    - **Lasso:** Along with *shrinking coefficients*, lasso performs *feature selection* as well. (Remember the ‘selection‘ in the lasso full-form?) As we observed earlier, some of the coefficients become exactly zero, which is equivalent to the particular feature being excluded from the model.\n","    \n","With advancements in Machine Learning, ridge and lasso regression provide very good solutions as they give much **better output**, require **fewer tuning parameters** and can be **automated** to a large extend.\n","\n","2. Typical Use Cases\n","\n","    - **Ridge:** It is majorly used to prevent *overfitting*. Since it includes all the features, it is not very useful in case of exorbitantly high #features, say in millions, as it will pose *computational challenges*.\n","    - **Lasso:** Since it provides *sparse solutions*, it is generally the model of choice (or some variant of this concept) for modelling cases where the #features are in millions or more. In such a case, getting a sparse solution is of great computational advantage as the features with zero coefficients can simply be ignored.\n","    \n","3. Presence of Highly Correlated Features\n","\n","    - **Ridge:** It generally works well even in presence of highly correlated features as it will include all of them in the model but the *coefficients will be distributed among them depending on the correlation*.\n","    - **Lasso:** It arbitrarily selects any one feature among the highly correlated ones and reduced the coefficients of the rest to zero. Also, the chosen variable changes randomly with change in model parameters. This generally *doesn’t work that well as compared to ridge regression*.\n","    \n","Along with Ridge and Lasso, ``Elastic Net`` is another useful techniques which combines both ``L1`` and ``L2`` regularization. It can be used to balance out the pros and cons of Ridge and Lasso regression."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"2WogCYibv_WQ"},"outputs":[],"source":["size = 100\n","\n","#We run the method 10 times with different random seeds\n","for i in range(10):\n","    print (\"Random seed %s\" % i)\n","    print()\n","    np.random.seed(seed=i)\n","    X_seed = np.random.normal(0, 1, size)\n","    X1 = X_seed + np.random.normal(0, .1, size)\n","    X2 = 2*X1+ np.random.normal(0, .1, size)\n","    X3 = X_seed + np.random.normal(0, .1, size)\n","    Y = X1 + X2 + X3 + np.random.normal(0, 1, size)\n","    X = np.array([X1, X2, X3]).T\n","\n","\n","    lr = LinearRegression()\n","    lr.fit(X,Y)\n","    print (\"Linear model:\", pretty_print_linear(lr.coef_, lr.intercept_))\n","    ridge = Ridge(alpha=10)\n","    ridge.fit(X,Y)\n","    print (\"Ridge model:\", pretty_print_linear(ridge.coef_, ridge.intercept_))\n","    print()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-7u5r4rBv_WQ"},"source":["## Resources\n","\n","- To go much more in-depth on linear regression, read Chapter 3 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), from which this lesson was adapted.
